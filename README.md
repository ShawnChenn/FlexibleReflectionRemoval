## 0. Todo
- [ ] Complete environment setup instruction.
- [ ] Provide dataset download link and pre-processing utilities.
- [ ] Provide model checkpoints and inference instruction.
- [ ] Provide custom training instruction.
- [ ] Provide custom evaluation instruction

## 1. Setting-Up Environment
Coming soon...

## 2. Dataset
Coming soon...


## 3. Model Checkpoints
Coming soon...

## 4. Training
Coming soon...
<!-- Run the following to start the training process:

```bash
./scripts/runs/train.sh <MODEL>
```

Where `<MODEL>` refers to the type of model to train, can be one of `PPFT`, `PPFTFreeze`, `PPFTScratch`, and `PPFTShallow`. Of course, it is welcomed to add your own models as extensions.

For example, to reproduce our final model, run:

```bash
./scripts/runs/train.sh PPFT
```

> Note that you can tune the training parameters inside the training script if you wish to do so.

Experiment artifacts will be stored under `./experiments/<MODEL_NAME>_train_<YYYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss>`. For example, `./experiments/PPFT_train_2024-03-11-17:00:59`. -->

## 5. Inference & Evaluation
Coming soon...
<!-- If reproducing our testing result is the only concern, please run:

```bash
./scripts/runs/test.sh
```
